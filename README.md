# Authentication System
i created a system where one can sign up, login, and reset his/her password both on logged in or before log in,
when a user forgets his/her password, the system can help getting a new one, or when a user feels his/her account is no longer secure
and wishes to change the password while already logged in, the system can as well help the user achieve that and any time a change
is made the user will receive a mail for notification.
and it can be texted locally you have your mailtrap ready: https://github.com/okoyechukwuma/login-system.git
