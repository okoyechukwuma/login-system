#  Full Authentication System
i created a system where a patient can sign up, login, and reset his/her password both on logged in or before log in,
when a patient forgets his/her password, the system can help getting a new one,
or when a patient feels his/her account is no longer secure and wishes to change the password while already logged in,
the system can as well help the user achieve that and any time a change is made the patient will receive a mail for notification.
when the patient logs in, the patient can see the date and time of logged in and can as well book an appointment with the medical team.
secondly a medical staff can as well logi, see the date and time of logged in  and can also view the all appointments which the patient made
and if their is no appointment the system will display no appointment yet .
And finally the Admin, this is the admin login details: email -> admin@gmail.com, password -> 123456. use the details displayed here to
log in as an admin to view all patients and meducal staffs.
this  can be tested locally as far as you have your mailtrap ready:
